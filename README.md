# Silhouette
A simple web game I built for my computer science grade 10 class final.

* Note: I was not allowed to edit the existing libraries by my Comp Sci teacher, Mr. Cheng. This is why there are some weird insert css workarounds, since I was not allowed to edit that file either.
* If you do want to play it, please don't give up, since there is a boss fight at the end! You can always skip levels by just editing the starting level in the code.

# Screenshots
Since you can't play the game on github, I have taken some screenshots to showcase what the game actually looks like in case you want to download and host it for yourself!
